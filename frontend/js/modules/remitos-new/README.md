Remitos (new) - scaffold

This folder contains a minimal scaffold for a new remitos implementation. It is intentionally small so we can iterate quickly.

Files:
- index.js: module entry with exported createRemitosModule(options)
- styles.css: placeholder for remitos styles

Next steps:
- Implement UI rendering functions
- Implement photo collection/resizing
- Integrate with API via fetch and handle token/session
